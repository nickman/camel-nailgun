/**
 * <p>Title: StreamProcessorPipelineFactory</p>
 * <p>Description: Factory for channel pipelines and channels to create a stream pipe which will process I/O as follows:<ul>
 * 	<li>The {@link NailgunRequestDecoder} will process input from the nailgun client's STDIN 
 * and write STDIN buffers and upstream events to the channel handler context of the pipeline created by this factory.</li>
 *  <li>The client stream handler will specify channel handlers to be placed in the pipeline to decode the nailgun client STDIN so it
 *  can consume that stream.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In summary, nailgun client supplied STDIN goes in, the decoded data comes out. If the handler specifies no handlers, the handler will
 * simply be called back with straight channel buffers.
